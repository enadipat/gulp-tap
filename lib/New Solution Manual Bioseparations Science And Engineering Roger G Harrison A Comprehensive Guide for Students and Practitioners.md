Bioseparations Science and Engineering by Roger G. Harrison is a comprehensive and up-to-date textbook that covers the fundamentals and applications of bioseparations in various fields. It provides a balanced coverage of both theoretical and practical aspects of bioseparations, with an emphasis on design and optimization of bioseparation processes. The book also integrates the latest developments and innovations in bioseparations, such as membrane-based separations, affinity separations, and bioanalytical techniques.
 
The book is divided into four parts: Part I introduces the basic concepts and principles of bioseparations, such as mass transfer, phase equilibria, thermodynamics, and kinetics. Part II covers the major bioseparation techniques, such as adsorption, chromatography, membrane separation, electrophoresis, extraction, crystallization, precipitation, and filtration. Part III discusses the design and analysis of bioseparation processes, such as scale-up, simulation, optimization, and validation. Part IV presents some case studies and applications of bioseparations in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, food, and environmental engineering.
