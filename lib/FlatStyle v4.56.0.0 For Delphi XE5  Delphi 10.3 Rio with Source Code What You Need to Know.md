# FlatStyle: A VCL Component Set for Delphi with a Flat Look
 
FlatStyle is a VCL component set for Borland Delphi that provides all commonly used GUI components (Buttons, Edits, etc.) in a nice flat look[^1^]. FlatStyle is compatible with Delphi XE5 to Delphi 10.3 Rio and comes with full source code[^2^].
 
FlatStyle allows you to customize the appearance of your applications by changing the colors, fonts, and styles of the components. You can also use FlatStyle to create your own custom components with a flat look. FlatStyle supports high DPI and themes, and works well with other third-party components[^2^].

## How to Use FlatStyle Components in Delphi
 
To use FlatStyle components in Delphi, you need to install the package first. You can download the source code from GitHub[^3^] or SourceForge and compile it with your Delphi version. Alternatively, you can use precompiled packages for Delphi 7 and Delphi 2007 from this link.
 
After installing the package, you will find the FlatStyle components in the FlatStyle tab of the component palette. You can use them just like any other standard VCL components, by dragging and dropping them on your forms or creating them dynamically in code. You can also access their properties and events in the Object Inspector.
 
FlatStyle components have some common properties that allow you to customize their appearance and behavior. For example, you can change the ActiveColor, DisabledColor, FontColor, BorderColor, and FlatColor properties to adjust the colors of the components. You can also set the Transparent property to true to make the components blend with the background. Some components also have specific properties that affect their functionality, such as AutoSize, Alignment, Checked, Style, etc.

FlatStyle components also support themes, which are predefined sets of colors and fonts that give a consistent look to your application. You can use the TFlatThemeManager component to apply a theme to all FlatStyle components on your form or in your application. You can choose from several built-in themes or create your own custom themes.

## Examples of Using FlatStyle Components in Delphi Code
 
To illustrate how to use FlatStyle components in Delphi code, let's create a simple application that uses a TFlatEdit, a TFlatButton, and a TFlatProgressBar. The application will allow the user to enter a number in the edit box and click the button to start a progress bar that counts up to that number.
 
First, create a new VCL Forms Application in Delphi and save it as FlatStyleDemo.dpr. Then, add the FlatStyle package to your project by choosing Project > Options > Packages > Add and selecting FlatStyle.dpk from the source folder. You should see the FlatStyle tab in the component palette.
 
Next, design your form by adding a TFlatEdit, a TFlatButton, and a TFlatProgressBar from the FlatStyle tab. You can change their properties in the Object Inspector as you like. For example, you can set the Caption of the button to 'Start', the Max of the progress bar to 100, and the Style of the progress bar to fsSolid.
 
Then, double-click on the button to create an OnClick event handler. In the code editor, add the following code:
  ```delphi procedure TForm1.FlatButton1Click(Sender: TObject); var   i: Integer;   n: Integer; begin   // Get the number from the edit box   n := StrToIntDef(FlatEdit1.Text, 0);   // Check if it is positive and less than or equal to 100   if (n > 0) and (n <= 100) then   begin     // Set the progress bar position to zero     FlatProgressBar1.Position := 0;     // Loop from 1 to n     for i := 1 to n do     begin       // Increase the progress bar position by one       FlatProgressBar1.Position := i;       // Update the form       Application.ProcessMessages;       // Wait for 50 milliseconds       Sleep(50);     end;   end; end; ```  
Finally, run your application and test it. You should see something like this:

As you can see, using FlatStyle components in Delphi code is very easy and straightforward. You can find more examples of using FlatStyle components in Delphi code on GitHub[^3^] or on Embarcadero's Code Examples website.
